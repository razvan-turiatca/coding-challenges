To train for an upcoming marathon, Johnny goes on one long-distance run each Saturday. He wants to track how often the number of miles he runs this Saturday exceeds the number of miles run the previous Saturday. This is called a progress day.

Create a function that takes in an array of miles run every Saturday and returns Johnny's total number of progress days.
