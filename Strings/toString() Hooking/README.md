# toString() Hooking

You have one job and one job only, to ruin the day of any unsuspecting victim using the toString() function. Hook the String prototype toString() to instead return a string that is in reverse.

## Examples

("Hello World!").toString() ➞ "!dlroW olleH"

("My hooking function! :3").toString() ➞ "3: !noitcnuf gnikooh yM"

("RaceCar").toString() ➞ "raCecaR"

## Notes

Remember that this is an object!
